# Sprint Summary 2 - Maile Brilhante

## Meeting Minutes
Our team aims to meet weekly on Wednesdays from 5-7 PM. However, during this sprint, we were only able to meet once outside of class. Due to this, a lot of communication between the frontend and backend teams happened over Discord. Fortunately, we were able to make good use of our in-class time to work together on our individual tasks.

At this point, the frontend and backend teams have began to work and communicate separately to coordinate tasks.

### Meeting 0 - 10/09/24, 5-7 PM

Topics Covered: We divided the team into frontend and backend, set up the server, configured Ktor, and initialized React.

## Rejected Tasks
There were no rejected tasks for this sprint.

## Disposition of Incomplete Tasks
None of the tasks were broken down into smaller tasks. Fully setting up the LogIn and SignUp pages has been pushed onto the next sprint. Fully setting up Capacitator and getting it to work has also been pushed onto the next sprint. There was not much the frontend team could do without the backend first fully setting up the databases and tables.  This sprint was mainly a lot of setting up and initializing and figuring out how things work together. No tasks were cancelled as unnecessary.
